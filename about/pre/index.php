		<h1>Welcome to the pre-season.</h1>
		<p>The pre-season is a chance for a large number of users to test out iFantasyFitness. This year there are a lot of new features, some of which are still in development. Since this will be Coach Moening's first year of running it, we need to be sure everything runs smoothly before handing it off.</p>
		<h3>How you can help</h3>
		<p>We are doing a full-blown competition from <strong>March 17 to April 21</strong>, 2014. That means with full rules, leaderboards, scoring, random teams, and everything.</p>
		<p><strong>Registration is from Saturday, March 8 at 8:00 AM CST to Sunday, March 16 at 10:00 PM CDT.</strong> Teams will then be randomly assigned at midnight on the 17th.</p>
		<p>To register, follow these steps:</p>
		<div class="alert alert-warning">
		<h4><i class="fa fa-warning"></i> <strong>Heads-up:</strong> Facebook login is <em>almost</em> working, but not quite yet. Google login is up and running.</h4>
		Thanks for your patience.

		<h3>How to report bugs!</h3>
		<div class="alert alert-info">
		<h4>The best way to report bugs is by sending an email to admin@ifantasyfitness.com with the subject line including "bug report" or "security report".</h4>
		If you have a non-security bug report, tweeting us @ifantasyfitness is ok too.
		</div>
		<p>Bugs are expected to happen. In fact, that's the point of the test - to find them. If you find silly or unexpected behavior, or you get redirected to a place you're not supposed to be, please report the bug.</p>
		<p><strong>The best way to report bugs is by e-mailing admin@ifantasyfitness.com.</strong> Alternatively, you can tweet us <a href="https://twitter.com/ifantasyfitness">@ifantasyfitness</a> with #bug.</p>
		<p>If you find a <strong>security bug</strong>, please email admin@ifantasyfitness.com (do <strong>NOT</strong> tweet us). Security bugs are bugs that allow you to gain access to others' accounts or data, or that allow you to break the site, database, or server. If you responsibly report a security bug, you get a special badge (<abbr title="This user responsibly reported a security issue."><i class="fa fa-terminal"></i></abbr>).</p>
		<p>Development usually occurs in the early afternoon or late evening, so you might find extra bugs during that time, though usually they'll be tested before being rolled out.</p>
		<p><strong>If you see <a href="/">the homepage</a> when you're not supposed to, please do not report that, as that page is under construction and should be live soon(ish).</strong></p>
		<h3>FAQ</h3>
		<h4>What's up with badges?</h4>
		<p>Badges are an experiment of recognizing achievements and completion of certain tasks on iFantasyFitness. When you receive a badge, it will appear in various places throughout the site. They haven't been enabled yet, but be on the lookout for them in the near future.</p>
		<h4>What are the new features?</h4>
		<p>Some of the new features include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Importing records from MapMyRun, Garmin, Strava, and RunKeeper <em>(coming soon)</em></li>
			<li>Progress bars for your season prediction and daily goal</li>
			<li>Printing reports of your records <em>(coming soon)</em></li>
			<li>A lot of back-end changes, allowing for easier updates and tweaks to the rules</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Do I <em>need</em> a Facebook or Google account?</h4>
		<p><strong>YES - you can only sign in with Facebook or Google.</strong> Using your Facebook or Google account has two advantages over using a proprietary account:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You have one less password to remember, and</li>
			<li>Your account information is safe and secure on Facebook and Google. This keeps your account, and our database, secure.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: You do <em>not</em> need your account to be Google+ enabled to sign in with Google.</p>
		<h4>When will the new features be available to test?</h4>
		<p>Some will be available soon, some will take a while to develop. iFF development is continuous, so expect new features or fixes often. Almost all functionality should be available for you to use by the first or second week in April.</p>
		<h4>Does the site work on mobile?</h4>
		<p><strong>YES!</strong> Grab your iPhone, iPad or other mobile device and head to ifantasyfitness.com. Some bits and bobs are in different spots on mobile than on the desktop, and a couple non-essential things are entirely gone from the mobile site.</p>
		<p>We value your feedback on the layout of the mobile site, no matter what kind of device you're using. Please send comments to admin@ifantasyfitness.com.</p>
		<p><em>For the sanity of your phone bill, we strongly advise that you use our site (and the web in general) only on Wi-Fi.</em></p>
		<h4>Why iFantasyFitness and not !FantasyFitness?</h4>
		<p>Because exclamation marks are not allowed in domain names, and fantasyfitness.com was taken. When referring to the game, both names are acceptable, but more people tend to (often times inadvertently) use <strong>i</strong>FantasyFitness.</p>
		<h4>Why are the teams random?</h4>
		<p>Because this is purely a testing run, and we can't fit a full draft in with so many events going on with all the activities. Future seasons will not use random teams.</p>
		<h3>Thank you!</h3>
		<p class="lead">As a token of appreciation, all participants in the testing season will receive a Beta Season badge (<abbr title="This user participated in the Beta Season, accelerating development and increasing iFF awesome."><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i></abbr>).</p>
